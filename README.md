# Analysis-of-Conway-s-Game-of-life-theory

The purpose of this assignment was to research the Conways' game of life theory,
a two dimensional grid of square cells that are either alive or dead according to
a specic set of rules. Each cell interacts with the eight cells that are vertically
horizontally or diagonally adjacent to it, these are called its neighbours [1].
Moreover, we were to explain and modify the code given to us to create multiple
simulations and create pseudo-population statistics with single or multiple
species.
